#✨ Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST)

This is a deep learning project where I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).
The model learns from thousands of small 28×28 grayscale images and predicts which digit appears in each one.

This project helped me understand image preprocessing, neural networks, convolutions, and model evaluation.

##📝 What This Project Does

Loads the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

Preprocesses the images (reshaping + normalization)

Builds a CNN model

Trains it to classify digits

Evaluates the model on unseen test images

Saves the trained model as a .h5 file

Can later be used to predict any new handwritten digit image

🧠 Why I Chose MNIST

MNIST is the “Hello World” of deep learning.
It’s clean, simple, and perfect for learning CNNs.

It allowed me to understand:

How convolution layers extract features

Why we use activation functions

Why softmax is used in multi-class classification

How flattening converts image features into predictions

How accuracy changes with epochs and batch size
