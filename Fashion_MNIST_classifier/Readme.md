👗 Fashion MNIST Image Classifier

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset, including shirts, sneakers, dresses and more. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

📌 Project Overview

This project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images into 10 clothing categories.
Fashion MNIST is a more challenging and modern alternative to the original MNIST digits dataset, making it ideal for beginners to practice computer vision tasks.

🧵 Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset contains:
70,000 grayscale images
28×28 pixels
10 classes
